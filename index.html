      <p>Hello!</p>
      <p>My name is Oscar. I'm from La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico. I did my bachelor's degree in Computer Science in UABCS (Universidad Autonoma de Baja California Sur) back in 2011.
      Right after I graduated I began to work as a GIS Analyst for the Mexican Government in their Secretariat of Agriculture (SAGARPA). 4 years and a half after that, I decided to
      pursue a Master's degree. I chose Canada as it has one of the best life quality in the world, and Queen's University because it is among the top ten post-secundary educational institues
      in Canada. Enrolled in 2016 and graduated in 2018, It took me a while to land a good job. I joined ESG Solution in 2019 as a Technical Support/Field Technician in Kingston, ON,
      but after 3 Months I got lay off.</p>
      <p>Currently I'm working for Oracle NetSuite as a Tehcnical Support Analyst and currently building professional experience to apply for a PR in Canada.</p></td>
